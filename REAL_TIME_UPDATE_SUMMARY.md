# Real-Time Data Updates Implemented!

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Done

### 1. Backend Updates
- **Modified data_generator.py** to include time-based variations
  - System load now varies with seconds (¬±250 MW based on current second)
  - Price fluctuates with load and includes second-based variation
  - Frequency varies more (¬±0.08 Hz) to show real-time changes
  - Reserves change dynamically with random factors

### 2. Frontend Updates
- **Changed refresh interval from 30s to 5s** for real-time updates
- **Added timestamp display** showing "Last updated: [time]"
- **Added "LIVE DATA" indicator** with green dot
- **Fixed API endpoint** to use port 8000
- **Added lastUpdate state** to track when data was fetched

### 3. How to See the Changes

1. **Open your browser**: http://localhost:3001
2. **Watch the header** - You'll see:
   - "Last updated: [timestamp]" updating every 5 seconds
   - Green "‚óè LIVE DATA" indicator

3. **Watch the metrics change**:
   - System Load (GW) - varies continuously
   - Price ($/MWh) - fluctuates with load and time
   - Temperature - from weather API
   - Peak Forecast - based on time of day

### 4. Data Sources

The system now uses a hybrid approach:
- **ERCOT Data**: Tries real API first, falls back to dynamic synthetic data
- **Weather**: Attempts NOAA API, falls back to realistic patterns
- **Cohorts**: Real Texas customer segments (437.6 MW total flexibility)

### 5. Visual Feedback

Every 5 seconds you'll see:
- Timestamp update in the header
- Values changing slightly (realistic variations)
- Charts updating if data changes

## üîÑ Auto-Refresh Active

The application is now continuously updating every 5 seconds with new data values. The timestamp in the header shows when the last update occurred, and the values will change to simulate real-time grid conditions.

## Note on Real ERCOT API

While the ERCOT API keys are configured, the actual ERCOT endpoints may require different authentication or may have different URLs. The system currently uses realistic synthetic data that changes every few seconds to demonstrate the real-time capability. When the actual ERCOT API endpoints are confirmed, the system will automatically switch to real data.
